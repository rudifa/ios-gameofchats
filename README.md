Built while following the video course series [Firebase Chat Messenger](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Firebase-Chat-Messenger) by [Brian Voong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-voong-2ba171a/) of [LetsBuildThatApp](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/) fame.

### Ep 1 How to Build a Login Page Using iOS9 Constraint Anchors

Brian teaches how to build an initial login page, skipping the .storyboard and writing swift 3 code instead.

XCode 9 is mostly helpful in making changes from swift 3 to swift 4.
